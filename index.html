		<h1>Your Arrival</h1>
		<p>Monday, 6th of November, 1784. It's a rainy day. Mr. Jackson's driver has been waiting in front of the railway station. Mr Jackson comes out of the railway station and the driver gets out of his car, opens the door and puts the suitcase into the trunk. He gets back into his car and says:</p>
		<div class="chat">
			<div class="them">Hello, my name is Mr. Instance. Did you have a pleasant trip?</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<p>
		You tell him you had a pleasant trip and where you want to go now. He is surprised after you told him but he drives off the station.
		You arrive at the castle. It's very cold and foggy outside and you hurry towards the majestic door. It's rusty and difficult to open but you lean against it and at last it opens. The front yard is huge and it takes you a few hundred steps to reach the big wooden door of the estate which is, to your surprise, open. You step in. There's no light in the entrance hall and your eyes first have to get accustomed to the dark, but this doesn't take a lot of time. There's another open door..</p>

			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="them">Well, these mysterious incidents were very dangerous for myself and very residents of MacMillan Castle. First of all we found a horrible letter in one of the bedchambers.</div>

			<div class="clear"></div>
			<div class="me">I will examine those premises.</div>
