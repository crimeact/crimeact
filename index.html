				<h1>Your Arrival</h1>
				<p>Monday, 6th of November, 1784. It's a rainy day. Mr. Jackson's driver has been waiting in front of the railway station. Mr Jackson comes out of the railway station and the driver gets out of his car, opens the door and puts the suitcase into the trunk. He gets back into his car and says: "Hello, my name is Mr. Instance. Did you have a pleasant trip?" You tell him you had a pleasant trip and where you want to go now. He is surprised after you told him but he drives off the station.
					
					You arrive at the castle. It's very cold and foggy outside and you hurry towards the majestic door. It's rusty and difficult to open but you lean against it and at least it opens. The frontyard is huge and it takes you a few hundred steps to reach the big wooden door of the estate which is, to your surprise, open. You step in. There's no light in the entrance hall and your eyes first have to get accustomed to the dark, but this doesn't take a lot of time. There's another open door..</p>

				<h1>In the bedroom</h1>
				<p>You go through it and enter a bedroom. It's neat and tidy but with you experienced eyes you notice a muddy footprint beneath the bed. This seems to be the first hint for you in a big network of lies and mysteries. You really have to talk about this with the earl...</p>

				<h1>Talk to the earl</h1>
				<p>
				It takes you very long to find your client, but at last you find him standing there alone in the drawing room. 
				"Good evening, my Lord. I am very delighted to help your Lordship."
				"Good evening, Mr Jackson. Welcome to MacMillan Castle. I hope you might be able to help us."
				"We all hope this, my Lord. But just to inform me exactily. Could your Lordship please explain me what happened in the dining room and in the other parts of the castle."
				"Well, these mysterious incidents were very dangerous for myself and very residents of MacMillan Castle. First of all we found a horrible letter in one of the bedchambers."
				"May I read it?"
				"With pleasure. Here, you are ..."
					<em>	Residents of MacMillan Castle,
						I am writing this letter to send a dark message. I am going to kill one of you during the next time. You all know me and might think I am a friend of yours but just in a moment of safety I will kill you, the person who destroyed my life.
						Be Careful
						The Black Rose
					</em>
				"Just incredible, right?"
				"Incredible and expectional. Really expectional ... And what else happened, my Lord?"
				"One evening the chandelier fell down on the table. Fortunately nobody was hurt but the chandelier was just two months old and cost a fortune. And we had just found the letter... I do not think this was an accident." 
				"I will examine those places. Is this everything, my Lord?"
				"Well, it is enough for one castle, isn't it?"
				"Definitely my LOrdship. So, I would now search more hints, if your Lordship does not need me here any more."
				"Perfectly okay. I'll see you later."
				"Thank you, my Lordship."
				
				You are now very confused. The earl gave you two places to think about...
