				<h1>Your Arrival</h1>
				<p>Monday, 6th of November, 1784. It's a rainy day. Mr. Jackson's driver waited in front of the railway station. Mr Jackson comes out of the railway station and the driver gets out of his car, opens the door and takes the suitcase into the trunk. He gets back into his car and said: "Hello, my name is Mr. Instance. Do you had a pleasant trip?" You tell him you had a pleasant trip and where you want to go now. He is surprised after you told him but he drove off the station.
					
					You arrive at the shire. It's very cold and foggy outside and you hurry towards the majestic door. It's rusty and difficult to open but you lean against it and at least it opens. The frontyard is huge and you need a few hundred steps to reach the big wooden door of the estate which is, to your surprise, open. You step in. There's no light in the entrance hall and your eyes first have to get accustomed to the dark, but this doesn't take a lot of time. Ther's another open door..</p>

				<h1>Talk to the earl</h1>
				<p>
				It takes you very long to find your client, but at last you find him standing there alone in the drawing room. 
				"Good evening Lordship MacMillan. I am very delighted to help your Lordship."
				"Good evening Mr Jackson. Welcome in MacMillan Castle. I hope you might be able to help us."
				"We all hope tis my Lordship. But just to inform me exactily. Could your Lordship please explain me what happened in the dining room and in the other parts of the castle."
				"Well, these mysterious incidents were very dangerous for myself and the every residents of MacMillan Castle. First of all we found a horrible letter in on of the bedchambers."
				"May I read it?"
				"With pleasure. Here, please..."
					<em>	Residents of MacMillan Castle,
						I am writing this letter to send a dark message. I am going to kill one of you during the next time. You all know me and might think I am a friend of yours but just in this moment of safety I will kill you, the person who destroyed my life.
						Be Careful
						The Black Rose
					</em>
				"Just incredible, right?"
				"Incredible and expectionally. Really expectionally... And what else happend, may Lordship?"
				"One evening the chandelier fall down on the table. Fortunately nobody was hurt but the chandelier was just two month old and we had just found the letter... I do not think this was an accident." 
				"I will examine those places. Is this everything, my Lordship?"
				"Well, it is enough for one shire isn't it?"
				"Definitely my LOrdship. So, I would now search more hints, if your Lordship does not need me here any more."
				"Perfectly okay. I'll see you later."
				"Thank you, my Lordship."
				
				You are now very confused. The eral gave you two places to think about...
