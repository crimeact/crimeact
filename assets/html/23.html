  <h1>Searching for more hints in the castle</h1>
  <p>You don't think you have enough hints to be sure who's the real murderer. You go through the big castle searching for anything to help you. You're unlucky, there are no more hints. As you come back to the living room, you find the earl laying in his blood.. <strong>You failed!</strong> </p>
