		<h1>Ask the Buttler some questions(letter)</h1>
		<p>
		You want the Buttler some questions and just when you meet him he sais:
		-"Ahh...Mr Jackson I searched you."
		-"Why?"
		-"Here I found this letter in the room of its lordship."
		-"May I read it please?"
		-"Of course. Here."

		There was enough time for you to see that I was not joking. But you can relax just the earl will die. See you soon.
		The black rose!
