		<h1>Arrest the Butler</h1>
		<p>You find the butler in the dining room, laying the table for dinner. You step behind him and put on the handcuffs. He's protesting with a thin and nervous voice and you're about to feel sorry about it, but you take him to the earl's car. Three days later the earl dies!</p>
