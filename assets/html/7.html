		<h1>Talk to the earl about the foot prints</h1>
		<p>You walk to the earl and tell him what you found.
		The earl tells you that he has a personal gardener and you can ask him about the foot prints.
		As you want to leave the earl stops you and tells you to also go int9 the dining to search for hints,
		because some time ago the chandelier fell next to the earl and he thought it was an attack on him personally.
