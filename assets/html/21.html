		<h1>Surround the house</h1>
		<p>The butler, the cleaning lady and some other inhabitants of Earl's household hide in the sourroundings of the castle to guard the Earl from the person who wants to kill him. But nobody knows if this person is a member of the family, a co-worker or a stranger. In the evening you come back to the Earl's house and find him bleeding at a chair in his room. He is dead.</p>
