		<h1>Talk to the earl</h1>
		<p>
		And after you have found out that the chandelier was sabotated by someone, you tell your insights to the earl and in the following you want to check the foot print found in the bedroom. So you go to the  gardener's house to tell him  you want to check the footprints which you found in the bedroom. When you have finished this, you either arrest the gardener or you return to the castle.
