		After you checked everything in the dining room you go to the earl to talk about about your insights. You find him in the bedroom while he is looking very closely at something.

    <div class="me">Hello, my Lord. What is this?</div>

    <div class="them">Mr Jackson! Look at this. Somebody was here where we found the letter. Here is a footprint. I guess it was the gardener... </div>
