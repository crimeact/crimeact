<h1>Don't eat</h1>
<p>
	All of you are sitting in the dining room eating the delicious dinner. It smells very good but first you look at the others. The earl eats his food with pleasure. So do the gardener and the cleaning lady. The butler serves the wine. Only the son of the earl looks a bit nervous and eats nothing.
