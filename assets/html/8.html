		<h1>Look at the Chandelier</h1>
		<p>You are in the dining room to research the crashed down chandelier and you notice that the rope was cut by somebody. Suddenly you hear steps behind you and turn around fast but the person leaves the room so fast that you can't recognize who it was. What do you want to do?</p>
