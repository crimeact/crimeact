		<h1>Talk to the earl</h1>
		<p>
		It takes you very long to find your client, but at last you find him standing there alone in the drawing room.
		"Good evening, my Lord. I am very delighted to help your Lordship."
		"Good evening, Mr Jackson. Welcome to MacMillan Castle. I hope you might be able to help us."
		"We all hope this, my Lord. But just to inform me exactily: Could your Lordship please explain me what happened in the dining room and in the other parts of the castle."
		"Well, these mysterious incidents were very dangerous for myself and very residents of MacMillan Castle. First of all we found a horrible letter in one of the bedchambers."
		"May I read it?"
		"With pleasure. Here, you are ..."
		<br><br>
		<div class="letter">
			<em>
				Residents of MacMillan Castle, <br>
				I am writing this letter to send a dark message. I am going to kill one of you during the next time. You all know me and might think I am a friend of yours but just in a moment of safety I will kill you, the person who destroyed my life.
				<br>Be Careful
				<br>The Black Rose

			"Just incredible, right?"
			"Incredible and expectional. Really expectional ... And what else happened, my Lord?"
			"One evening the chandelier fell down on the table. Fortunately nobody was hurt but the chandelier was just two months old 	and cost a fortune. And we had just found the letter... I do not think this was an accident."
			"I will examine those premises. Is this everything, my Lord?"
			"Well, it is enough for one castle, isn't it?"
			"Definitely, my Lord. So, I would now search for more hints, if your Lordship does not need me here any more."
			"Perfectly okay. I'll see you later."
			"Thank you, my Lordship."
			<br>
			You are now very confused. The earl gave you two places to think about...
